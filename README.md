## 🔧 Development Log & Problem Solving
During the development of this project, I successfully navigated several high-level technical challenges:
* **Dependency Management:** Resolved complex Rollup/Vite build errors related to Radix UI versioning and peer dependencies.
* **API Optimization:** Implemented asynchronous fetching with loading states to prevent UI crashes and "white-screen" errors during data retrieval.
* **Git Version Control:** Managed and resolved critical merge conflicts during the deployment phase to ensure a clean production branch.
